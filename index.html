          Hi, I'm Dimitar Mandarliev!

        </h1>
        <p>
          Welcome ðŸ‘‹, My name is Dimitar; I'm a Technical Product Manager based
          in Sofia, Bulgaria. I have worked in Hewlett Packard and DXC and in
          the last 3 years I've been working in Commerzbank. I'm currently
          focused on learning full stack web development not only to help
          developers in my current role, but also to help myself change to a
          more developer-oriented role.
